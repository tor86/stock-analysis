**Green Stock Analysis**
---
_**Overview of Project**_
---
Analyze 12 green energy stocks for our client Steve to present to their parents. Showing the return rates for 2017 and 2018 with color coded cells to show which had a positive return and which had a negative return, to assist them in making a more informed decision. 

Buttons were also added in the worksheet so Steve can pull whichever year they would like to work with.

We took the original code and refactored to assist Steve with future use and running thousands of stock options and save time in executing the macro.
